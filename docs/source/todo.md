# TODO

## Scientific Core (The Math)
* [X] Optional data normalization (homothetic scaling) for numerical stability.
* [ ] Class `Kline` and `Lplot` (Linear kriging & profiling).
* [ ] Alternative methods for selecting nearest neighbors.

## IO & Interoperability
* [ ] Export to GeoTIFF (GIS compatibility).
* [ ] Save/Load state for Kgrid objects.
* [ ] Difference analysis (Surface A - Surface B) *Experimental*

## Edge Computing (Raspberry Pi focus)
* [ ] Memory-mapping for large grids.
* [ ] Thermal-throttling awareness (temp-based core management).

## Visualization
* [ ] Environment-aware plotting (auto-detect Jupyter for interactive widgets).
